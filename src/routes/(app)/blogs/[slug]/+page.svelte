			I'm hard-pressed to remember a game with as shockingly effective an opening as Alan Wake 2.
			From the outset, Remedy Entertainment makes its intent explicitly clear: to amplify every
			facet of its 2010 action-horror cult classic, and in doing so, subvert interactive
			storytelling tropes at every turn. Astoundingly, the studio’s grasp meets its reach,
			delivering an experience far darker, deeper, and weirder than anything it has crafted before.
			“This is not the story I wanted it to be,” Wake gravely warns in an opening monologue. “This
			is not the ending that I wanted.” Indeed, this is not the original aborted sequel to Alan Wake
			that was conceived all the way back in 2010. Alan Wake 2 is something altogether different
			and, in a post-Control world, something with production values and scale that the studio never
			would have had all those years ago. Picking up 13 in-game years after the events of the first
			game, Alan Wake 2 stars not only the eponymous writer turned interdimensional warrior, but
			also a new protagonist in the form of Saga Anderson: an FBI profiler who arrives in the
			Pacific Northwest town of Bright Falls, Washington, to investigate the latest in a series of
			mysterious disappearances and murders supposedly linked to a deranged cult. Upon arriving,
			Saga and her partner, Alex Casey — a jaded yet affirming mentor with an affinity for coffee,
			and the likeness of creative director Sam Lake — deduce that the murders may also be linked to
			Wake, who disappeared over a decade earlier. The pair quickly find themselves at the heart of
			a terrifying mystery, one that threatens to not only endanger their lives, but reshape the
			very fabric of reality as a whole.
